# VaccinationData project
create by: Orel Aviad, Elhanan Aviad, Eliav Aviad
## mission
Some countries do not keep electronic records of their citizens medical situation. We want to help them collect data from citizens in order to prioritise COVID-19 vaccination.


- Registration Page: Citizens will enter their information in a form as follows:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Date of birth
- Address
- City (a dropdown)
- Zip code (optional)
- Land line
- Cellular phone
- Checkbox whether they have been infected by COVID-19 before
- multi-check options for previous conditions like (Diabetes, Cardio-Vascular problems, Allergies..etc) with a text box for the user to enter "Other" conditions

2- Summary Page: A tabular view that shows all the existing registration info available in the system. With a search grid to search by a)Date of birth (date range) b) City

Bonus Task: Add the ability to export the table into excel.
